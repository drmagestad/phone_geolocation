# Phone Number Info & Mapping Tool

A simple tool to extract detailed information about a phone number, including its international format, country, carrier, and timezone. Additionally, it can generate an interactive map showing the geographical location of the number based on its country.

It leverages the `phonenumbers` library for phone parsing, `geopy` with Photon for geolocation, and `folium` to create a visual map. This is a basic, beginner-friendly project designed for learning and experimentation, with potential for future enhancements.
